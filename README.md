## Abstract
Background: Hospital outbreaks of multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa are often caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa clones which produce metallo-β-lactamases, such as Verona Integron-encoded Metallo-β-lactamase (VIM). Although different sources have been identified, the exact transmission routes often remain unknown. However, quantifying the role of different transmission routes of VIM-PA is important for tailoring infection prevention and control measures. The aim of this study is to quantify the relative importance of different transmission routes by applying a mathematical transmission model using admission and discharge dates as well as surveillance culture data of patients.

Methods: We analyzed VIM-PA surveillance data collected between 2010 and 2018 of two intensive-care unit (ICU) wards for adult patients of the Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam using a mathematical transmission model. We distinguished two transmission routes: Direct cross-transmission and a persistent environmental route. Based on admission, discharge dates, and surveillance cultures, we estimated the proportion of transmissions assigned to each of the routes. 

Results: Our study shows that only 13.7% (95% credibility interval: 1.4%, 29%) of the transmissions that occurred in these two ICU wards were likely caused by cross-transmission, leaving the vast majority of transmissions (86.3%, 95% credibility interval: 71%, 98.6%) due to persistent environmental contamination. 
Conclusions: Our results emphasize that persistent contamination of the environment may be an important driver of nosocomial transmissions of VIM-PA in ICUs. To minimize the transmission risk from the environment, potential reservoirs should be regularly and thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, or redesigned.
